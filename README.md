# Airbnb Rentals in Barcelona

I have been involved in the development of this project about Airbnb rentals in Barcelona. To carry out this project, we used the Airbnb Barcelona data extracted from Inside Airbnb, a web that scraps Airbnb data of the world cities. The project consists of various parts:
* Data Preprocessing (Dimensionality Reduction, Missings imputation, Outlier detection and imputation)
* Multiple Correspondence Analysis (To determine how the categorical features affect the price)
* Advanced Clustering and Profiling (To extract classes of apartments and explain easely and visualy the class information)
* Time Series (To see the airbnb growth around the world and how Covid-19 affected the rentals)
* Text mining to clusterize the apartments descriptions
* Sentiment analysis (To extract how the apartments were rated from the reviews and compare it with the real rating in search of data manipulation)

All the project was developed in R, and dates from June 2023.
